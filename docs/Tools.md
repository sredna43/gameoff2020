# Tools

## Here is a short list of all the tools I recommend for GameDev:

### Game Engine
1. Godot Engine (pronouced GOD-oh or GO-doh _not_ GO-DOTT)

### Art
1. Krita/GIMP for photoshop alternatives
2. Inkscape for an Illustrator alternative
3. Aseprite for pixel art (reach out to me for a license)
4. PureRef for reference art - such a great tool
5. Blender - If we go 3D, Blender literally cannot be beaten for the best 3D tool

### Music
1. LMMS

### Miscelaneous
1. VSCode, classic
2. Windows Terminal

## Setting up VSCode with Godot:
Go to:
Editor -> Editor Settings -> Text Editor -> External

From there, you'll want to copy and paste the path to the executable (most likely under "C:/Users/<username>/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft VS Code/Code.exe"). 
If your VSCode is installed somewhere else, just right click on the shortcut and keep pressing "Open File Location" until you find the file `Code.exe`. Copy the path to that file and paste it into the "Exec path" field inside Godot.
